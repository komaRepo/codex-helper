# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Codex Helper.

## Before you start

- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Keep changes focused and avoid unrelated refactors.
- Do not include account data, tokens, cookies, local paths, or screenshots
  containing personal information.
- Use [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerabilities.

## Development requirements

- macOS 13 or later
- Swift 6.3 toolchain
- A local Codex installation for optional integration checks

## Local workflow

```bash
git clone https://github.com/komaRepo/codex-helper.git
cd codex-helper

make test
make package
make public-release-check
```

Run the live integration check only when Codex is installed and signed in:

```bash
make integration-test
```

Format Swift sources before committing:

```bash
swift format --in-place --recursive Sources Tests Package.swift
swift format lint --recursive Sources Tests Package.swift
```

## Pull requests

A pull request should include:

1. A concise problem statement.
2. The implementation approach.
3. Verification commands and observed results.
4. Screenshots for visible UI changes.
5. Compatibility notes for Codex protocol changes.

All pull requests must pass the macOS CI workflow.

## Protocol changes

The app intentionally communicates through the local Codex app-server instead
of reading authentication material. Preserve that boundary when adding
features.

If a Codex response shape changes:

- update the decoding models
- keep unknown fields forward-compatible
- add a deterministic verifier fixture
- run the live integration check when possible
